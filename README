# Order Execution Engine (Assignment)

This repo implements an order-execution engine (mock DEX routing + queue + worker + WebSocket streaming) used for the assignment.
It supports placing orders via HTTP, routing between Raydium and Meteora (mocked), queueing with BullMQ, worker processing, DB persistence, and WebSocket streaming of lifecycle events.

---

## Quick status
- ✅ HTTP API: `POST /api/orders/execute` — returns `orderId`
- ✅ WebSocket: `GET /ws/:orderId` — streams live order lifecycle events
- ✅ DB: Postgres tables `orders`, `order_events`, `order_failures`
- ✅ Queue: BullMQ + Redis
- ✅ Worker: `src/workers/orderWorker.ts` with routing + retry logic
- ✅ Mock DEX: `src/services/mockDexRouter.ts` (quotes + execute)
- ✅ Tests: Jest examples included

## Local dev (exact steps)

**Prereqs:** Docker Desktop (compose), Node.js 18+, npm, Postman or Hoppscotch.

1. Clone repo
2. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and update if needed (default values work with docker-compose).
3. Start infra (Postgres + Redis + Adminer):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
